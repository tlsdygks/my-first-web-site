    <h2>Cat</h2>
    <p>
        The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated
        species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild
        members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely
        and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill
        rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]
