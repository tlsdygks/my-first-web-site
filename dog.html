    <h2>Dog</h2>
    <p>
        The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant of
        the wolf which is characterized by an upturning tail. The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,[6][7] and
        the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.[8] The dog was the first species to be
        domesticated,[9][8] by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[7] before the development of agriculture.[1]
